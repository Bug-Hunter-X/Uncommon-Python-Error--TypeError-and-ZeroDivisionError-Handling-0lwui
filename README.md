This repository contains examples of uncommon errors in Python, specifically focusing on `TypeError` and `ZeroDivisionError`.  The `bug.py` file demonstrates the error, while `bugSolution.py` provides an improved version with robust error handling.  The goal is to highlight the importance of input validation and comprehensive exception handling in preventing unexpected program behavior and improving code reliability.
